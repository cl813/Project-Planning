    "## Methods and Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "To predict whether a player subscribes to the newsletter based on their age, experience, and playtime, we will be using the K-nearest-neighbour classification model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since KNN is a non-parameteric and intuitive method that classifies players based on the similarity of their characteristics to others in the dataset, it seemed to be the most appropriate option. It also requires minimal assumptions, which include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Observations that are close together in feature space are likely to belong to the same class.\n",
    "- Predictor variables must be numeric and scaled so that distance calculations are meaningful.\n",
    "- The choice of K significantly affects model performance, so it must be tuned carefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, using the KNN model can present a few potential limitations which are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sensitive to irrelevant variables and scaling.\n",
    "- Choice of k matters, which must be tuned using cross-validation.\n",
    "- KNN does not provide easily interpretable coefficients, so interpretation may require additional visual elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to do this, we first split the data into 80% training and 20% testing sets, stratifying for `subscribe`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "must tune the parameter k, using cross-validation against the training data, so we can compare it to different values of k, choosing the best option."
