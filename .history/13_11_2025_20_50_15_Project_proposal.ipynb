    "\n",
    "To classify predict whether a player subscribes to the newsletter based on their age, experience, and playtime we will be using the K-nearest-neighbour classification model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since KNN is a non-paramteric and intuitive method that classifies players based on the similarity of their characteristics to other in the dataset, it seemed to be the most appropriate option. It also requires minimal assumptions, which include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Observations that are close together in feature space are likely to belong in the same class.\n",
    "- Predictor variables must be numeric and scaled, so that distance calculations are meaningful.\n",
    "- The choice of K significantly affects model performace, so it must be tuned carefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, using the knn model can present a few potential limitation, which are:\n",

    "Potential Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "KNN can be computationally expensive for large datasets, though this dataset is relatively small.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is sensitive to irrelevant or highly correlated features.\n",
    "\n",
    "KNN does not produce coefficients that directly show variable importance, so interpretation may require additional visual or model-based tools (e.g., feature importance from tree-based models).\n",
    "\n",
    "Model Evaluation Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Splitting:\n",
    "\n",
    "Split the dataset into 70% training and 30% testing subsets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-Validation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use 5-fold cross-validation on the training set to select the optimal number of neighbours (K) by minimizing classification error or maximizing F1 score.\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluation Metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "Assess model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve).\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparison:\n",
    "\n",
    "Compare KNN results with a simple logistic regression baseline to determine whether a nonlinear, distance-based model improves predictive accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Processing Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "Encoding: Convert categorical variables (e.g., experience) into numeric dummy variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scaling: Standardize numeric features (Age, played_hours) to zero mean and unit variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Selection: Evaluate which variables most improve predictive accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Training: Fit KNN classifier on the processed training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Validation: Tune the number of neighbours (K) using grid search and cross-validation.\n",

    "Testing: Evaluate the tuned model on the held-out test data and interpret results.\n",
    "\n",
    "✍️ Summary Paragraph\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach will help determine whether players with similar profiles (in terms of age, experience, and playtime) share similar subscription behaviours. By comparing model performance across different values of K, we can assess how well similarity in these features predicts newsletter engagement. This method is especially suitable when relationships between predictors and outcomes are complex or non-linear — a likely scenario in human gameplay data."
